                        <p>California's state water management is both physically interconnected and institutionally fragmented. While these institutions publish their data, there is a lack of standardization of that data and protocols to access data, across
                            different instituions. This leads to poor sharing, aggregation, and analysis of the water across California. </p>
                        <h2>Opportunities </h2>
                        <p>One such framework for assembling information collected by different agencies into consistent water accounts is the Water Data Transfer Format (WDTF) which was jointly developed by Australia's Bureau of Meterology (BoM) and the
                            <strong>Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</strong> (<strong>CSIRO</strong>). WDTF provides both standard data formats as well as data delivery mechanisms. WDTF is a robust standard that has been used
                            by the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS). AWRIS is a centralized platform that collates and analyses national near real-time data from agencies and authorities monitoring reservoirs, stream levels, diversions,
                            and groundwater levels. The platform also presents climate data that can be integrated with local modeling to help users manage their systems. AWRIS seves as a useful model based on which the platform described in the Open
                            and Transparent Data water act can be built.</p>
                        <p>Another standard that could be used is WaterML 2.0. This standard was developed was developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), United States Geological
                            Survey (USGS), Aquatic Informatics, KISTERS and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, and has been approved by the Open Geospatial Consortium as an official standard. </p>
