            <p>California's state water management is both physically interconnected and institutionally fragmented. This along with the lack of data standards and protocols hinders compatibility among datasets, leading to poor sharing, aggregation, and
                analysis of the water accross California.</p>
            <p>Standards are necessary for aggregating up to the regional and state levels and for making valid comparisons across localities and regions. Standard accounting also facilitates audits, which enhance accountability and reliability in water
                contracts and agreements. California has been improving in this regard—for instance, with efforts to standardize information that urban suppliers provide in their Urban Water Management Plans. But the state lacks a framework for assembling
                information collected by different agencies into consistent water accounts.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left text-muted">Opportunities </h3>
            <p>Public Policy Institute of California has conducted an extensive study in the water accounting systems around the world that recognises best practices in the field. Comparable in size and geographic variety, Australia's efforts in water management
                could serve a starting point to building an integrated water management system in California. Australia’s national government provides a central information platform collates and analyses national near real-time data from agencies and
                authorities monitoring reservoirs, stream levels, diversions, and groundwater levels. The platform also presents climate data that can be integrated with local modeling to help users manage their systems.&nbsp;Australia could also serve
                as a model for the public benefit corporation required under to create and manage the water accounting system, as a similar entity, the now defunctNational Water Commision, was created in order to make water management viable across the
                country. The functions of the NWC are now handled by several agencies and its work was the foundation of Australia's water data Platform.</p>
